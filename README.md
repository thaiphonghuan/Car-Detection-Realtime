## Objective
The project aims to analyze and predict real-time traffic flow by detecting vehicles in two live-streamed videos on YouTube:

- Tokyo Shinjuku 
- Colorado State Highway 82 (Grand Avenue, facing North) through downtown Glenwood Springs, Colorado

  
By leveraging the YOLOv8 object detection model, the project will provide real-time insights into traffic density, flow patterns, and vehicle counts at these locations, and project traffic conditions for one of the locations based on live data trends.
